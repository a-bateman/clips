Command Line Interface Programs

This is a project to replace GNU Coreutils with a set of programs, written entirely in c/c++, and licensed to be more permissive.

You are expected to understand that all files are currently released under the MIT license but will be released under the LOLicense (Hereby referred to as LOL) once its details are ironed out.

Files that are in a ready to use state will be under a directory using the format "READY-foo".

Files that are in a work in progress state will be under a directory using the format "WIP-bar".
