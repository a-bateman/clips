# Announcements

This file will contain any major announcements and changes effecting clips in a reverse chronological order (newest at the top, oldest at the bottom).  Each new announcement will be mirrored in the pinned message on the telegram group for the project (https://t.me/joinchat/KG5lhAvsbtt7uQfOGkBr9g) and discussions/debates of the changes are expected to be held there.

At this point in time we are working on getting the clips that are already out into a READY state.  We are also working on making clips POSIX compliant and will focus on releasing all future clips with this goal in mind.  If you're working on the project please make sure to push and pull routinely to get the most recent updates.  Thank you to everyone who has shown interest in clips or have just kept us busy chatting on our telegram group!  We look forward to working with and hearing from you all.

# 12-5-18:
Added colorink, written by Wittmaxi (https://github.com/Wittmaxi/Colorink) as a dependency.  Currently used in lfs.  Will be used through other current clips and in other clips in the future.  For the foreseeable future colorink will only be used where piping is not expected to be an occurance.  This is due to the fact that colorink may not play well with piped data.

Please update your repo and install colorink, and commander (https://github.com/Wittmaxi/CommandEr), if you have yet to do so to make working on the project easier.  I would like to extend a thank you to Whittmaxi for his dedication to the project and implementing features such as these.

# 12-4-18:
The Clips repo has been restructured to make it easier to understand.  No programs have been removed but contributing.md has been updated.  Please take a look at it if you plan on contributing as it holds the guidelines for the project.

I would also like to extend a thank you, immensely, to anyone contributing to the project so far.
