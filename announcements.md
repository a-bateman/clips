# Announcements

This file will contain any major announcements and changes effecting clips in a reverse chronological order (newest at the top, oldest at the bottom).  Each new announcement will be mirrored in the pinned message on the telegram group for the project (https://t.me/joinchat/KG5lhAvsbtt7uQfOGkBr9g) and discussions/debates of the changes are expected to be held there.

#12-4-18:
The Clips repo has been restructured to make it easier to understand.  No programs have been removed but contributing.md has been updated.  Please take a look at it if you plan on contributing as it's holds the guidelines for the project.
I would also like to extend a thank you, immensely, to anyone contributing to the project so far.
